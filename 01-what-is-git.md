# What is Git?

Git is a version control system that is used for software development and other version control tasks. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 to manage the development of the Linux kernel. Git allows developers to keep track of changes made to their code, collaborate with others on a project, and revert to previous versions if necessary.

Git works by creating a repository (or "repo") that contains all the files and folders associated with a project. Developers can make changes to their code and then "commit" those changes to the repository. Each commit is like a snapshot of the code at a particular point in time, with information about who made the change and why.

Git also supports branching and merging, which allows developers to work on multiple versions of the code at the same time. Each branch represents a separate line of development, and changes made to one branch can be merged into another when they are ready.

In addition to its use in software development, Git can be used for a variety of version control tasks, including managing configuration files and tracking changes to documents. Git is open source software, which means that it is free to use and can be modified by anyone.
