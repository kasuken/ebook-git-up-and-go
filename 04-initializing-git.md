# Initializing Git

1. Open the terminal: To initialize Git, you'll need to use the terminal (or command prompt) on your computer. Open the terminal by searching for "Terminal" or "Command Prompt" in your operating system's search bar.
2. Navigate to your repository: Use the "cd" command to navigate to the folder that you chose as your Git repository. For example, if your repository is located in the "SourceCode" folder, you would type "cd SourceCode" and press Enter.
3. Initialize Git: Type the following command to initialize Git in your repository:

```bash
git init
```

This will create a new Git repository in the folder you have navigated to. It creates an hidden folder to keep track of changes.
