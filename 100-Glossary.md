Repository: A place where Git stores all the files and their history for a particular project.

Commit: A saved snapshot of changes to one or more files in the repository.

Branch: A separate line of development that diverges from the main codebase, allowing you to make changes without affecting the main codebase.
Merge: Combining changes from one branch into another.

Pull: Fetching changes from a remote repository and merging them into a local branch.

Push: Sending changes from a local branch to a remote repository.

Remote: A repository that is hosted on a different server than the local repository.

Fork: A copy of a repository that allows you to make changes without affecting the original repository.

Clone: Creating a copy of a remote repository on your local machine.

Pull Request: A request to merge changes from one branch or fork into another branch, typically used in open source projects to facilitate collaboration.

Rebase: Changing the base of a branch to a different commit, typically used to incorporate changes from another branch.

Tag: A named reference to a specific commit in the repository history, often used to mark important versions or releases.

Conflict: A situation where Git is unable to automatically merge changes between two branches, requiring manual intervention to resolve the differences.
